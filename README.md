# Bike_Share_Analysis

1. jupyterwork folder contains data subfolder which has data of three cities New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC about
      their bike share system which include tripduration, starttime, stoptime, start station id, start station name, start
      station latitude, start station longitude, end station id, end station name, end station latitude, end station longitude,
      bikeid, usertype, birth year, gender.
      
2. jupyterwork folder contains Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb which is a jupyter notebook file.This file is used to perform analysis of
      bike sharing system.
      
3. Bike_Share_Analysis.html is a html type file of Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb.     

## Introduction
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.
In this project, perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.
